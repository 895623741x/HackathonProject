## Inspiration

Research is a time-consuming process for every researcher and applicant. From the application submission to receiving by the researching institute, hundreds of assignment requests waiting to be manually matched always waste the golden time of the sample. As a result, we want to solve the tedious process that was originally charged by human resources to reduce the meaningless waiting time of expert assignments.

## What it does

We create an online application system that will receive a user's application and list it on the dashboard to track whether their applications have been successfully received by the research institute. The users can either submit through the form provided by our platform or upload the CSV file directly to save the time of filling the survey.

## How we built it

The frontend page was built by the React.js framework which will help us collect the manual fill-in survey and uploaded CSV files. In the backend, we use Node.js to save the uploaded CSV files in our local storage so that the manager of the online application can also keep a copy of the CSV file to preserve it for other further utilization.

## Challenges we ran into

The most difficult issue was to overcome the online uploaded file storing in the local storage. We donâ€™t want to make an extra feature to manually download the uploaded CSV since this process may cause the problem that the system manager would not instantly preserve the file that users submit.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The challenge to automatically preserve the CSV file from the client-side is the most rewarding accomplishment that we built throughout the coding phase. We successfully added the automation process for the app to save time for both user and manager so that the researchers would not waste their time waiting for the system to check and preserve by human resources.

## What we learned

We learn the importance of automation that contributes to the researching community. Even though this feature does not directly make an impact on the result of research, it still indirectly boosts the quality of the research to a higher level which significantly creates a friendly environment for the users who may not have abundant time to wait for their research result.

## What's next for Brain Canada Application System

We will keep moving on to make the system open to the experts and applicants with more complete and compact functions to concisely reach their needs their purpose for research assignments. In the future, our team aims to design an even more automatic system such as applicant habit memory, rapid matching for researcher expertise, and matching priority for the applications with a closer deadline, to benefit the academic field with a faster, more convenient tool for them to maximally save the precious time.
